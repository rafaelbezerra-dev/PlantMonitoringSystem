# Plant Monitoring System

The Plant Monitoring System consists of an web application that continuously receive data from a monitoring node. The web app should also display the data received and secure the access to the information. All the automated tasks should have a manual mode, in which the user himself start the task.

## Contributor
This project was create by [Rafael Nascimento Bezerra](https://github.com/rafaelbezerra-dev).

## IoT level
![IoT level Level 3](https://github.com/rafaelbezerra-dev/PlantMonitoringSystem/blob/master/doc/iot_level.jpg)

## Hardware: 

The hardware used to make this project possible was:

Raspberry Pi Model 2



### Input/output
(CSI, DSI, GPIO, I2C, SPI, serial, UART, etc.)

### Network
(WAN, LAN, PAN, or BAN)

## Software
### Communication model: (request/respond or pub/sub)
The communication is based on requests and responses using REST architecture. The web server acts most of the time as a proxy for the database. The is no direct access to the database. Instead of this, every app (mobile, web or local) must perform requests to the server.
### Data
The Monitoring Node code supports the following measurements:
* 
Humidity
* 
Light Level
* 
Soil Moisture
* 
Temperature (of the air and soil)

### Storage
